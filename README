NAME
    RDF::Service - The Wraf core library


DESCRIPTION
    Wraf implements a RDF API that hopes to realize the Semantic
    Web. The framework uses RDF for data, user interface, modules and
    object methods. It uses interfaces to other sources in order to
    integrate all data in one enviroment, regardless of storage form


WARNING
    This is alfa software.  Be careful.


PREREQUISITIES
    Perl v5.6 with Template v2, Time::Hires, CGI, DBI, URI and
    PostgreSQL


INSTALL
    The test program cgi-bin/person.cgi and the ones in t will look
    for the libraries in ../lib (relative to the executable).  But if
    you would like to install the libraries anyway, do the:

    perl ./Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

    Create the database wraf_v01a in PostgreSQL and initiate it with
    the tables in doc/rdf.sql

    Make the CGI program executable from a webserver


DEVELOPMENT
    The homepage for Wraf is http://www.uxn.nu/wraf/ there you can
    find the developers mailinglist and more background information.
    Please send any comments to the developer mailinglist.
