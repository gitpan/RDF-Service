DESCRIPTION
    Wraf implements a RDF API that hopes to realize the Semantic
    Web. The framework uses RDF for data, user interface, modules and
    object methods. It uses interfaces to other sources in order to
    integrate all data in one enviroment, regardless of storage form.

    The homepage for Wraf is http://www.uxn.nu/wraf/ there you can
    find the developers mailinglist and more background information.
    Please send any comments to the developer mailinglist.
