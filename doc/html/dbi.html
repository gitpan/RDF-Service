    <h1>Wraf DBI Interface</h1>

    <p>Statements storeded in a DBI interface will have their
      resources also stored in the DB. If you say that a specific
      class is a subClassOf another class, this means that the URI
      subClassOf is stored in the DB, even if it is primarly handled
      by the RDFS interface.
    </p>


    <h2>Models</h2>

    <p>The node will point to a model and that model will hold
      information about the origin of the information and then it was
      last updated. The agent will be the URI for the server and the
      source will be the URI of the interface.  The details of this
      has not been developed.
    </p>

    <h2>Interfaces</h2>

    <p>The object in the cache will be marked with the interface that
      handles its storage/retrievel. Other modules could offer methods
      for the object.
    </p>

    <p>A search for a resource will use the range/content of the
      object. The find method for a model will search its contents, a
      find for a interface will search the interface and a find for
      the RDF::Service object will search all connected interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>It's one thing to be the owner or home interface of a node, and
      antoher thing to say something about the node or with the
      node. If we want to know everything said about a thing, we will
      have to search all interfaces that could give a part of the
      answer. But if we only want to know whats said from a limited
      number or sources, we can restrict the search to the interfaces
      that handles the models owned by the source we are intrested in.
