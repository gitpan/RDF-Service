      Web Resource Application Framework

    <h1>Web Resource Application Framework</h1>
    
    <p>Wraf implements a <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> API.
      The purpose is to enable the construction of applications that
      fully uses the RDF data model in order to realize <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/" >the Semantic
      Web</a>.</p>
    
    <ol>
      
      <li>All data is described in RDF</li>

      <li>The User Interface is defined in RDF.  Data presentation
	will be dependent on the user profile, situation context, and
	just what information can be found from trusted sources.</li>

      <li>All functions and program code are named, described and
	handled as RDF Literals.  Running an application can result in
	method calls to services on other internet servers.  New
	functions could by reference transparently be downladed and
	executed from trusted sources.  The actual code is <a
	href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> but the system could be
	extended to recognize other languages.</li>

      <li>The development of applications is done in the same system
	used to run the application.  Wraf will be extended
	and developed from within iteself.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Wraf uses interfaces to other sources in order to integrate all
      data in one enviroment, regardless of storage format.  You can
      read and update information from configuration files, databases,
      XML files, LDAP, etc.</p>

    <p>The system will use intelligent caching and optimizations in
      order to gain in speed without sacrifice any flexibility.  A
      persistant backend service deamon will take requests from
      clients in <a href="http://perl.apache.org">mod_perl</a>.  Other
      non-browser interfaces could also use the service.</p>

    <p>Wraf will be idealy suited for complex, interconnected systems
      there the addition of new data often breakes the previous format
      and the exceptions is the rule.  It can be used for personalized
      content generation, topic communities, intranets and more.</p>
